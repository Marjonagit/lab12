# Firebase Firestore Integration

This repository contains two projects that demonstrate the integration of Firebase Firestore for saving and reading data in real-time. The goal is to have changes reflected live in both projects.

## Project 1: Save Data to Firestore

### Screen 1: Save Data
- A screen with a text widget displaying information received from Firestore
- A text field to get data from the user
- A button to save user-entered data to Firestore

### How to Run Project 1 & 2
